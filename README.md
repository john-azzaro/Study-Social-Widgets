## What is the Social Widgets Study?
Social widgets are a great way getting customers to add social interaction and support for your product or service.  "Social Widgets Study" is an examination of various social media button, timelines, etc. from providers such as facebook, twitter, etc.  This study currently has 3 widgets including a facebook "like" button, twitter "tweet" button, and a twitter timeline.  More example of social widgets will be added in the future.

Here are a few questions I examine in this study:

## What are the key takeaways from the Social Widgets Study?

<dl>

### ALL social media widgets come prepackaged
--------
<dd> 

Pretty straight forward, all social media platforms will have a prepackaged button to use on your site. This study dealt with exactly those buttons (i.e. twitter, facebook, facebook timeline) where the script is embedded directly into the page. Note that there are more elegant and orginazied solutions where the scripts can be stored in seperate files but for a superficial study it works out rather well.

## Does the Widgets Study feature commentary?
Yes! Commentary for the social widgets study can be found in the processNotes.txt file.  For each widget, I provide step-by-step instructions on how navigate the documentation, aqquire the elements and scripts, how to insert them into your HTML document, and additional data attributes to customize your widget!
