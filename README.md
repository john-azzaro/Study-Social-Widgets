## What is the Social Widgets Study?
Social widgets are a great way getting customers to add social interaction and support for your product or service.  "Social Widgets Study" is an examination of various social media button, timelines, etc. from providers such as facebook, twitter, etc.  This study currently has 3 widgets including a facebook "like" button, twitter "tweet" button, and a twitter timeline.  More example of social widgets will be added in the future.

## Does the Widgets Study feature commentary?
Yes! Commentary for the social widgets study can be found in the processNotes.txt file.  For each widget, I provide step-by-step instructions on how navigate the documentation, aqquire the elements and scripts, how to insert them into your HTML document, and additional data attributes to customize your widget!
